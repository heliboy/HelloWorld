Hi Hubot, i like node.js and coffeescript too(thats what i'm made of).
I've had tacos on the moon and find them far superior to those i've had on earth.

no really my is david and i like c, c++, objective c, fortran, php, javascript, html, visual basic and assembly language.

I really don't like tacos whereever they have come from...
