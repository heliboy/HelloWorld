Hi Hubot, i like node.js and coffeescript too(thats what i'm made of).
I've had tacos on the moon and find them far superior to those i've had on earth.

no really my real name is david, and i like to code using; c, c++, objective c, fortran, php, javascript, html, visual basic and assembly language.

And, I really don't like tacos where ever they come from...
